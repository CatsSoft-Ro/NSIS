ipicsplash.dll - plug-in on the base of AdvSplash
Read AdvSlpash Readme for the list of options.

diff:
1. While plug-in suports jpg, gif, tiff and other image types,
   do not forget to set file extension in the "ipicsplash::show",
   call, for example:

     ipicsplash::show 1000 600 400 -1 $PLUGINSDIR\my_mom.jpg

2. New entry point for sound
     ipicsplash::play /NOUNLOAD $PLUGINSDIR\bububu.wav
   I could hear sound on Win98 this way only.

3. thats all. It is also easy to extract transparency index from
   gif89a header, but I left all "as it is" for compatibility
   with other image types and not to increase dll size.
   png and tiff is still a problem.
