What is this?
-------------

  ExtractDLLEx is a extension DLL for NSIS. It can decompress one or 
  more files from a container file which was created with 
  compressfile.exe before. It is especially useful in combination
  with NSISdl so that you don't have to download large files 
  uncompressed.
  

Usage
-----

  Decompression (within NSIS script):
  - Push path and name of compressed file and then path and name of 
    temporary destination file on top of the stack.
  - Call the function "extract" with CallInstDLL
  - On Success, the string "success" is on top of the stack, else an 
    error message.
  - The decompressed files are created in the same directory like 
    the script executable NSIS script file.
  - The second filename is only used for temporary file access!
  
  Compression (outside NSIS script or using !system):
  - Call CompressFile.exe with the name of the compressed file 
    and the uncompressed files as parameters. You can use relative
    paths of the actual directory. The usage of wildcards like * and
    ? is also supported!
  - Use always / and not \ in your paths!
  - Don't use / in front of relative paths.
  - ../ is not supported in relative paths.
  - CompressFile needs the lzma.exe file!
  
  
Example
-------

  Compression Example:
  
  CompressFile.exe test.7z test.* te?t.exe test1/test2/test.txt
  
  
  Decompression Example (NSIS script):

    Push "test.7z"
    Push "update.tmp"
  
    ExtractDllEx::extract
  
    ;get the result
    Pop $0
    StrCmp $0 success SUCCESS
      MessageBox MB_OK|MB_ICONSTOP "$0"
  
    SUCCESS:
    
    
Process Overview
----------------

  ; batch file to compress files
  CompressFile.exe test.7z test.* test/test.txt
  
  
         test.exe      test.dat    test/test.txt
                 \        |        /
                  \       |       /
                   \      |      /
                    \     |     /
  CompressFile.exe   \    |    /
                      pack.tmp (hardcoded in CompressFile)
                          |
                          |
                       test.7z
  --------------------------------------------------------
                       test.7z   
                          |
                          |
                      update.tmp (temporary file!)
  ExtractDLLEx.dll    /   |   \
                     /    |    \
                    /     |     \
                   /      |      \
                  /       |       \
          test.exe     test.dat    test/test.txt
          
  
  ; nsis script to unpack files
  Push "test.7z"
  Push "update.tmp"
    
  ExtractDllEx::extract
    
  ;get the result
  Pop $0
  StrCmp $0 success SUCCESS
    MessageBox MB_OK|MB_ICONSTOP "$0"
    
  SUCCESS:


Known limitations
-----------------

  Zlip and LZMA compression are included. The included plugin supports
  only LZMA because of the better compression ans smaller filesize.
