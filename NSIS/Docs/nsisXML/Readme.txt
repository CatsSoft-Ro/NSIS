nsisXML -- Small NSIS plugin to manipulate XML data through MSXML
Web site: http://wiz0u.free.fr/prog/nsisXML
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can typically use it to:
- create, read, modify, write XML files
- create, remove, search XML nodes
- set/get nodes content or attributes

Notes
-----
* For simplicity, I decided to use variables $0 through $3 for most parameters and
	return values, instead of pushing/popping values using the stack
	Therefore, avoid using these variables for something else while dealing with
	nsisXML
* It is a known issue that MEMORY IS NOT CORRECTLY RELEASED after using this
	plugin. (and this probably wont be corrected) 
	It usually won't matter much if you deal with small XML files, but if memory
	leaks is a bad issue for you, then don't use nsisXML.
* UTF8 text is generated for characters outside 7-bits ASCII range but I'm not
	sure about codepage issue if the installer runs on a different codepage system
	I suggest you don't supply constant strings in NSIS with such characters to
	nsisXML. However strings based on the target system (like paths) should be ok.
* Newly-created XML file won't be nicely indented (but it's still correct XML !)
	If you load, modify and save an XML file that was already indented, it will be
	nicely indented (this is how MSXML works)
* To accelerate speed, you can specify /NOUNLOAD as first parameter for all plugin
	calls EXCEPT THE LAST ONE. This avoids the plugin DLL to be loaded/unloaded
	for each call. The last call must however not specify /NOUNLOAD in order for
	the DLL to be unloaded and the $PLUGINSDIR to be correctly cleared at the end
	of your installer
* Plugin requires, of course, that MSXML be already installed on the target system
	It should run fine with any version of MSXML. Check MS Knowledge Base Q269238
	for versions of MSXML shipped with Windows & Internet Explorer

Variables meaning
-----------------
$0	reference to the XML document root (integer)
$1	reference to a parent node (integer)
$2	reference to a child node (integer)
$3	depends - see functions description

Usage
-----
nsisXML::create
	creates an empty XML document in memory and returns its reference in $0 and $1

nsisXML::load <filename>
	load given XML file into document $0
	REQUIRES that an XML document be already created in $0
	(if XML document $0 is not empty, all content will be discarded)
	sets $0 to 0 if an error occured

nsisXML::loadAndValidate <filename>
	same as load but performs validation on the XML if a schema is present, and
	resolves external definitions (may try to establish an Internet connection)

nsisXML::save <filename>
	saves current document $0 to given file

nsisXML::createProcessingInstruction <target> <data>
	creates a new 'processing instruction' node and return its reference in $2

nsisXML::createElement <tag name>
	creates a new element node with given tag name (initially empty) and return its
	reference in $2

nsisXML::appendChild
	appends node $2 as a child of node $1

nsisXML::insertBefore
	insert node $2 as a child of node $1, to the left of node $3
	($3 must be a reference to a child node of $1)

nsisXML::setAttribute <attribute name> <value>
	sets the given attribute with the given value on node $2

nsisXML::getAttribute <attribute name>
	returns in $3 the value for the given attribute name of node $2
	if attribute is not found, returns an empty string

nsisXML::setText <content text>
	sets the text content of the node $2 (<>the text between the tags</>)

nsisXML::getText
	returns in $3 the text content for node $2

nsisXML::select <XPath expression>
	find the first node matching the given XPath expression and return its
	reference in $1 and $2
	if not found, reference will be 0

nsisXML::parentNode
	returns in $1 the reference on the parent node of node $2

nsisXML::removeChild
	removes node $2 from the childs list of node $1


Sample script #1
-----------------
	nsisXML::create
	nsisXML::createProcessingInstruction "xml" 'version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"'
	nsisXML::appendChild
	nsisXML::createElement "main"	; create main document element node
	nsisXML::appendChild
	StrCpy $1 $2			; lets move to this node and create its childs:
	nsisXML::createElement "child"
	nsisXML::setAttribute "attrib" "value"
	nsisXML::setText "content"
	nsisXML::appendChild
	nsisXML::createElement "child"
	nsisXML::setAttribute "attrib" "value2"
	nsisXML::setAttribute "active" "yes"
	nsisXML::setText "content2"
	nsisXML::appendChild
	nsisXML::save "Sample.xml"

This script creates the following XML file:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<main><child attrib="value">content</child><child attrib="value2" active="yes">content2</child></main>

Sample script #2 (using /NOUNLOAD)
-----------------
	nsisXML::create /NOUNLOAD
	nsisXML::load /NOUNLOAD "Sample.xml"
	nsisXML::select /NOUNLOAD '/main/child[@attrib="value2"]'
	IntCmp $2 0 notFound
	nsisXML::getAttribute /NOUNLOAD "active"
	DetailPrint "Attribute 'active' is $3"
	nsisXML::getText /NOUNLOAD
	DetailPrint "Tag <child> contains $3"
	nsisXML::parentNode /NOUNLOAD
	nsisXML::removeChild /NOUNLOAD
	nsisXML::save "Sample.xml"

If applied on the previous "Sample.xml" file, this will print out "value2",
then "content2", and modify Sample.xml to become:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<main><child attrib="value">content</child></main>
