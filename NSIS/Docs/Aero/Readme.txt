Aero NSIS plug-in

Author:  Stuart 'Afrow UK' Welch
Company: Afrow Soft Ltd
Date:    24th April 2014
Version: 1.0.1.1

Enables Windows Aero glass effect on the NSIS UI. This effect is only
available on Vista/7, and when Aero is enabled. On Windows 8 the border
is extended in the same way but with no transparency.

See Examples\Aero\*.

Back/Next/Cancel Button Rendering
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The plug-in implements 2 different methods for rendering the buttons
  correctly on Aero glass; however neither of these methods are perfect.
  Both methods work on all supported Windows versions (Vista, 7, 8).

  New Method (Default):-

    Asks Windows to paint the button without any text to a memory buffer
    on behalf of the plug-in, and then draws the button text onto that
    image.

    Benefits:
    * Added glow effect to the button text.
    * Little or no flicker of buttons or text on navigation.

    Drawbacks:
    * Keyboard accelerators do not work and are hidden.

  Old Method (Pre 1.0.0.7):-

    Asks Windows to paint the button and its text to a memory buffer on
    behalf of the plug-in, and then ensures the content region of the
    button is opaque so that the button text is rendered correctly.

    Benefits:
    * Keyboard accelerators work correctly.

    Drawbacks:
    * Noticable white text flicker on navigation.
    * No text glow effect.

  Both methods result in the mouse in/out fade animation being lost and
  this is unavoidable.

Options
